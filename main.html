	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. 
		An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. 
		It is often represented using notations like O(n) to describe how memory usage grows with input size.
